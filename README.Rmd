## Overview
Writing impromptu functions to transform your data is one of the most common
procedures in data science, but this can often lead to complicated and confusing
code, even when performing relatively simple operations. `concise` gives you a
set of tools to apply clean and intelligible anonymous functions that
transform your data while keeping your code concise and easily readable. `concise`
functions are modelled on familiar `tidyverse` functions like `purrr::map` and 
`dplyr::mutate`, but with a layer of syntactic sugar to make anonymous functions
that can condense a paragraph's worth of code into a single line.

* Refer to data columns directly -- avoid placeholder pronouns like `.x` or `..1`
and instead refer to your data by name inside function definitions.
* Leverages `purrr`'s mapping functions to outperform slow `dplyr::rowwise` operations
and facilitate non-rowwise column mutations in the same call.
* Helpful shorthand gives access to column properties like row number, the size 
of grouped data (i.e. cardinality) and the names attribute inside the iterative
function.
* Interact with and preserve groups created by `dplyr::group_by`.
* Access the entire data column alongside individual elements to write custom
summary and window functions like moving averages.
* Refer to anonymous functions inside their own definitions to write recursive
functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of concise from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/domjarkey/concise) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("domjarkey/concise")
```

## Usage

### `cmutate`

`cmutate` is equivalent to `dplyr`'s `mutate` but with the additional option of
evaluating column definitions as a lambda function iteratively applied to each row.
Columns defined using `~` instead of `=` will be evaluated as an anonymous 
function with special `concise` syntax.

This allows for the easy application of non-vectorised functions on a row-by-row
basis.

```{r cmutate, message=FALSE}
library(concise)

# The is.null function is not vectorised, so normally can't be called on an entire
# column unless a function like purrr::map is used
tibble(fruit = list('apple', 'banana', NULL, 'dragonfruit', NULL)) |>
    cmutate(fruit_exists ~ !is.null(fruit))
```

As with `dplyr::mutate`, ordinary column mutations can also be called with `=`,
and multiple mutations can be performed at once, able to make reference to columns
created or modified within the same function call:

```{r cmutate2, message=FALSE}
tibble(fruit = list('apple', 'banana', NULL, 'dragonfruit', NULL)) |>
    cmutate(
        fruit_exists ~ !is.null(fruit),
        fruit_name_length ~ ifelse(fruit_exists, stringr::str_length(fruit), 0),
        fruit = as.character(ifelse(fruit_exists, fruit, "NO FRUIT FOUND"))
    )
```

#### Examples

##### Find the largest element of multiple columns:

`concise` handles expressions marked with a `~` using its own simplified syntax,
but behind the scenes it passes any columns called to `purrr`'s `pmap` function.
This makes it computationally faster and more versatile than the equivalent operation
using `dplyr::rowwise` while making your source code easier to write and clearer
to read.

```{r}
# This data frame will be referred to in the next few examples
numbers <- tibble(
    x = c(29L, 11L, 72L, 81L, 27L, 61L, 42L, 26L, 57L, 39L),
    y = c(38L, 80L, 98L, 93L, 34L, 26L, 4L, 31L, 18L, 69L),
    z = c(31L, 83L, 91L, 69L, 82L, 65L, 75L, 3L, 20L, 71L)
)
```

##### Calculate a moving average of the three latest entries:

`concise` allows the use of special pronouns to refer to things like the row index
(`.i`), the final row index of the data (`.n`), or the entire column as a vector
(`<column_name>.col`). These can be used to make simple, intelligible window functions.

```{r}
numbers |> cmutate(
    avg_of_last_3_z_values ~ mean(z.col[max(.i - 3, 1):.i])
)
```

##### Use pronouns in combination with data groupings

When data is grouped, the `<column_name>.grp` pronoun refers to all elements of the
data in the same group as a vector, while `<column_name>.col` will refer to the
entire, ungrouped column. Similarly, `.i` will refer to the index of the element
in the group, while `.I` will refer to the absolute row index.

```{r}
numbers$letter <- rep(c('A', 'B'), each = 5)

numbers |>
    select(letter, x) |>
    group_by(letter) |>
    cmutate(
        prop_of_group ~ x / sum(x.grp),
        prop_of_whole ~ x / sum(x.col),
        group_row_index ~ .i,
        column_row_index ~ .I
    )
```

Note: Similar to `.i`/`.I`, when data is grouped, `.n` refers to size of the group,
while `.N` refers to the total number of rows in the entire data frame.

##### Specifying data type with `?`

By default, `cmutate` simplifies the output to the
most suitable data type. On occasion, it may be necessary to explicitly specify
the data type of the output column, similar to calling `map_int` or `map_chr`.
This can be done using the `?` operator as in the following example:

```{r warning=FALSE}
numbers |>
    select(x, y, z) |>
    cmutate(
        max ~ max(x, y, z),
        max_int ~ max(x, y, z) ? int,
        max_dbl ~ max(x, y, z) ? dbl,
        max_chr ~ max(x, y, z) ? chr,
        max_list ~ max(x, y, z) ? list,
    )
```

<!-- N.B. As with `purrr`'s mapping functions, `?` won't automatically coerce any data -->
<!-- type, so it is recommended to use functions such as `as.integer` or `as.character` -->
<!-- where appropriate. -->

### `rmap` and `cmap`

`rmap` (short for "row map") applies an anonymous function to the rows of a data
frame while allowing  the columns to be referred to directly inside the function
definition. As with `cmutate` and other `concise` functions, pronouns such as
`.i` (the index or position in the element in the list) are able to be used.

`rmap` works similarly to `purrr::pmap` except the input data frame does not need
to be subsetted to only those columns used in the function. By default, `rmap`
returns a list, but the data type of the output vector can also specified with a
suffix in a similar fashion to other `purrr` map functions, e.g. `rmap_chr`,
`rmap_dbl`, `rmap_df`, etc.

```{r}
numbers |>
    rmap(~ paste0("\n\tRow ", .i, ", Group ", letter, ": ", mean(c(x, y, z)))) |>
    cat()
```

`cmap` is equivalent to `purrr::map`, applying an anonymous function iteratively
to a list input, except it also allows for use of `concise` pronouns. In the
below example, `.nm` is used to refer to the `names` attribute for each element
in the input vector, and `.col` refers to the entire input vector.

```{r}
state_areas <- state.area
names(state_areas) <- state.name

head(state_areas)

state_areas |>
    cmap_df(
        ~ c(
            state = .nm,
            larger_than_median_state = .x > median(.col)
        )
    )
```

Note: If the column of an input data frame is a named vector, the `<column_name>.nm`
pronoun can be used in `rmap` and `cmutate` function definitions in a similar
fashion.

### Recursion in `concise`

It can sometimes be useful to define a function recursively, performing the
same computation on an output until a base case is reached. This is not always
the advisable, but in certain circumstances such as list traversal or web
scraping, it can be handy to call a function inside itself to complete a task 
with an indeterminate amount of steps. In `concise` function definitions, this
can be accomplished using the `.this` pronoun.

The canonical example of recursion is Fibonacci's sequence, where the first two
terms are defined as 1 and 1 (or sometimes 0 and 1), and the nth term is defined
as the sum of the two previous terms. This sequence can be succinctly computed using
`cmap`:

```{r}
cmap_int(1:10, ~ if (.x <= 2) {1} else {.this(.x - 1) + .this(.x - 2)})
```

Tree-like structures or nested lists can be traversed recursively to extract
leaf nodes or to collapse them into a standardised format.

```{r}
tree <- list(
    a = list(
        b = 1,
        c = list(
            d = 2,
            e = 3
        )
    ),
    f = 4,
    g = list(h = 5)
)

cmap_df(
    tree,
    ~ if (is.list(.x)) {
        purrr::pmap_df(
            list(.x, .nm = names(.x)),
            .this,
            path = paste0(path, "/", .nm)
        )
    } else {
        tibble(path = paste0(path, "/", .nm), value = .x)
    },
    path = "root"
)
```

### `concise` infix operators

The `concise` package also includes three infix operators designed to be used
to make applying key-value or dictionary lookups easier to use and more understandable
for readers of your code. These infixes provide a straightforward syntax for mapping
from one set to another as an alternative to relying on joins and cross-walk
datasets.

`%from%` and `%to%` are designed to work as a pair of ternary operators, mapping
an input vector *from* a set of keys *to* a set of values.

```{r}
# Map a sequence of letters to their numerical positions in the alphabet
c('d', 'o', 'g') %from% letters %to% 1:26
# Look up the abbreviations for US states
c('California', 'Virginia', 'Texas') %from% state.name %to% state.abb
```

The `%with%` operator allows a preceding expression to be evaluated *with* a
data.frame or named list object as the local environment. Below we use `dplyr`'s
`starwars` dataset as an example.

```{r}
data("starwars", package = "dplyr")
head(starwars)
# Find mean height of characters in the starwars dataset
mean(height, na.rm = TRUE) %with% starwars
```

`%with%` can even be used in combination with `%from%` and `%to%`:
```{r}
# Map character names to species using the starwars dataset
c("Han Solo", "R2-D2", "Chewbacca") %from% name %to% species %with% starwars
```
